Webmention Client
=================

Client library for sending [webmention](http://webmention.org) and [pingback](http://indiewebcamp.com/pingback) notifications.

Usage
-----

```php
<?php
$client = new AaronParecki\MentionClient($url);
$client->debug = true;
$sent = $client->sendSupportedMentions();

echo "Sent $sent mentions\n";
?>
```

This will find all absolute links on the page at `$url` and will attempt to send
mentions to each. This is accomplished by doing a HEAD request and looking at the headers
for supported servers, if none are found, then it searches the body of the page.

After finding either pingback or webmention endpoints, the request is sent to each.


Pingback
--------

If you want to accept pingbacks on your site, check out [pingback.me](http://pingback.me)
which handles accepting the XMLRPC request and exposes the data via an API.


Webmention
----------

To learn more about Webmention, see [webmention.org](http://webmention.org).

The [pingback.me](http://pingback.me) project can also act as a pingback->webmention
proxy which will allow you to accept pingbacks as if they were sent as JSON webmentions.
